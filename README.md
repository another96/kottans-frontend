## Git
Git is one of the things I've never had to use. I know the basics of how it works along with why its use is necessary. I hope in this course to be able to use it to a solid level of knowledge.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP
In this section there was nothing new for me. Give me a little look at what I already knew.

## Git Collaboration
I followed the git lessons. I will use the learned commands from now on and understand better what I am doing. I have enjoyed learning git as if it were a game, where changes are shown graphically which makes it easier to learn.

## Intro to HTML and CSS
I already had a good base in this part. I skipped it.

## Responsive Web Design
A very important part of css. I had knowledge of grid and a little practice. On the other hand, flexbox I had to learn it from scratch.
