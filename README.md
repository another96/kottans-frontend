## Git
Git is one of the things I've never had to use. I know the basics of how it works along with why its use is necessary. I hope in this course to be able to use it to a solid level of knowledge.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP
In this section there was nothing new for me. Give me a little look at what I already knew.

## Git Collaboration
I followed the git lessons. I will use the learned commands from now on and understand better what I am doing. I have enjoyed learning git as if it were a game, where changes are shown graphically which makes it easier to learn.

## Intro to HTML and CSS
I already had a good base in this part. I skipped it.

## Responsive Web Design
A very important part of css. I had knowledge of grid and a little practice. On the other hand, flexbox I had to learn it from scratch.


## JS Basics
This part was completely new to me. Although I must say that before I had already touched other programming languages such as java and c#. They are quite similar, right now the main drawback I see is that js is not typed. This leads to unwanted errors and forces you to understand things better before doing them.  
 * Basic JavaScript: it was a point where I learned the basics of the language. Although if you know any other language you can advance quite fast.
 * ES6 Challenges: it was a point where almost everything was new. I have been making a small cheat sheet with the main points. What I know best is let and const.
 * Basic Data Structures: another very fast point. Making notes at the same time will facilitate later the use of all the presented methods since it is impossible that they stay in memory so first.
 * Basic Algorithm Scripting: the basic algorithms exercises, together with the methods in the previous section's cheat sheet, were easy to solve. Some not the first time. In many cases my code was very long looking at the solutions, it could always be solved in several lines.
 * Algorithm Scripting Challenges:this point is :this is where I spent the most time. But this is what I like the most in programming, to find a problem and after some time to reach the solution, is what fills you with energy and desire to continue.
After this section I had created a profile in letcode to do more problems of this style and the most important thing to get more familiar with the language.
